# Rerum Playground
This is a web space that uses the RERUM installation of the Research Computing Group at Saint Louis University to explore the possibilities of interoperable tools and standards. By using the Tiny Things sandbox, users can immediately create reusable JSON-LD objects that conform to IIIF and Web Annotation standards and find new ways to interact with them.

**RERUM Playground** is a web-based toolset enabling users to work with IIIF manifests and JSON-LD objects. Users can bring their own manifest or create one within the playground, then use the listed tools to visualize, edit, and redirect the manifest to other compatible applications.

## Overview

This project allows users to create, interact with, and manage IIIF-compliant JSON-LD objects, with an intuitive interface.

### Key Features
- **Manifest Handling**: Import or create IIIF manifests.
- **Tool Integration**: Choose tools to interact with manifests, redirecting to compatible applications.
- **Local Storage**: Manifests persist locally for easy access across sessions.
